# Analysis of Alcohol and Cannabis in Canada Since Recreational Cannabis Legalization
### By Adam DeBrouwere

This project offers an analysis of alcohol and cannabis consumption and sales trends in Canada following the legalization of recreational cannabis in October 2018. Using data from Statistics Canada, the visualizations aim to provide insights without promoting either substance.

## Features

- **Yearly Sales Plots**: Visual representation of alcohol and cannabis sales trends.
- **Combined Sales Growth**: Line and bar charts showing the growth rates of alcohol and cannabis sales over time.
- **Market Share Visualizations**: Pie charts breaking down market shares for various alcohol and cannabis products.
- **Consumption Analysis**: Line plots analyzing alcohol and cannabis usage across age groups.

## Project Structure

### Frontend
- React-based application displaying all visualizations.

### Backend
- Django API providing the data and dynamic visualizations.

## Data Sources

- **Statistics Canada** (Retail trade and market share data)
- **Government of Canada Substance Use Surveys**

    ```

## Deployment

The project can be deployed using services like Render for the backend and Netlify for the frontend:

- **Backend**: Django backend deployed on Render.
- **Frontend**: React app hosted on Netlify.

## Visualizations

- **Alcohol and Cannabis Use**: Interactive line plots displaying reported usage by age demographics (2013–2023).
- **Yearly Sales**: Visualizations of annual sales trends for alcohol and cannabis products from 2019–2024.
- **Combined Growth**: Side-by-side comparison of sales growth for both markets post-legalization.
- **Market Share**: Breakdown of product popularity within the alcohol and cannabis sectors.

## Sources

- **Monthly Retail Trade Sales** (Statistics Canada)
- **Alcohol Sales Data** (Open Canada)
- **Cannabis Sales Data** (Open Canada)
- **Canadian Alcohol and Drugs Survey** (2013, 2015, 2017, 2019)

## Conclusion

The data suggests a potential correlation between the legalization of cannabis and shifts in alcohol consumption. Cannabis edibles, in particular, appear to have influenced alcohol sales in Canada.
