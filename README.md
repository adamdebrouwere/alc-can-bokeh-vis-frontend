# Analysis of Alcohol and Cannabis in Canada Since Recreational Cannabis Legalization
### By Adam DeBrouwere

This project offers an analysis of alcohol and cannabis consumption and sales trends in Canada following the legalization of recreational cannabis in October 2018. Using data from Statistics Canada, the visualizations aim to provide insights without promoting either substance. See it fully deployed [here](https://alc-can-market-analysis.netlify.app/).

## Features

- **Yearly Sales Plots**: Visual representation of alcohol and cannabis sales trends.
- **Combined Sales Growth**: Line and bar charts showing the growth rates of alcohol and cannabis sales over time.
- **Market Share Visualizations**: Pie charts breaking down market shares for various alcohol and cannabis products.
- **Consumption Analysis**: Line plots analyzing alcohol and cannabis usage across age groups.

## Project Structure

### Frontend
- React-based application displaying all visualizations.

### Backend
- Django API providing the data and dynamic visualizations.

## Data Sources

- **Statistics Canada** (Retail trade and market share data)
- **Government of Canada Substance Use Surveys**

## Visualizations

- **Combined Growth**: Side-by-side comparison of sales growth for both markets post-legalization.
